# Multiple-disease-prediction-project

Welcome to the Multiple Disease Prediction Project! This project aims to develop a system capable of predicting the likelihood of multiple diseases based on various input parameters such as symptoms, medical history, and demographic information. The web app was built using machine learning principles and deployed using Streamlit. You can access the web app using this link https://multiple-disease-prediction-project-mqvyrn55nvkq9zcrkhrrmt.streamlit.app/. <br>
This README file provides an overview of the project, including its purpose, features, and usage guidelines.

Purpose:
The primary purpose of this project is to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing multiple diseases efficiently and accurately. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and predictive modeling techniques, the system aims to provide valuable insights into potential diseases, enabling early detection and proactive healthcare management.

Features:
- Multiple Disease Prediction: The system can predict the likelihood of several diseases such as diabetes, thyroid disease and heart diseases based on input parameters.
-  User-friendly Interface: The project includes an intuitive user interface for easy input of symptoms, medical history, and demographic information.
- Machine Learning Models:  Various machine learning models are utilized to predict disease probabilities, including random forests and extreme gradient boosting algorithms.

Usage Guidelines:
-  Input Parameters: Provide relevant information such as symptoms, medical history, and demographic details through the user interface.
-  Prediction Results:  After submitting the input parameters, the system will generate prediction probabilities for multiple diseases.
- Interpretation:  Interpret the prediction results cautiously, considering them as indicators rather than definitive diagnoses. Consult with healthcare professionals for accurate diagnosis and treatment recommendations.
-  Feedback and Improvement:  Your feedback is valuable for enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of the prediction models. Feel free to contribute suggestions or report any issues via the project repository's issue tracker.
